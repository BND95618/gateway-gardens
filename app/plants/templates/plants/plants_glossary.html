    <h3>Cultivar</h3>
    <p class="w3-margin-left">
      A specific plant variety that has been intentionally bred by humans to 
      possess desirable characteristics, meaning it is cultivated and maintained 
      through human intervention; essentially, a cultivar is a "cultivated 
      variety" of a plant species.  The term cultivar is a blended word for 
      “cultivated variety".  Cultivars are capitalized and enclosed in single quotes.
    </p>

    <h3>Fertilizer NPK</h3>
    <p class="w3-margin-left">
      The NPK ratio represents the availability of Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium, 
      by weight, contained in a plant fertilizer.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          N = Nitrogen: Helps leaves grow and gives plants a deep green color
        </li>
        <li>
          P = Phosphorus: Helps roots develop and absorb nutrients
        </li>
        <li>
          K = Potasium: Helps plants convert food into energy and strengthens plant blades
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Genus</h3>
      <p class="w3-margin-left">
        Naming: Capitalize and italize.
      </p>

    <h3>Hybrid</h3>
    <p class="w3-margin-left">
      A hybrid plant is the offspring of a cross between two different species 
      or varieties. Hybrids have greater genetic variability than their parents. 
      Hybrid plants tend to be more vigorous than their parents, and often have 
      faster growth, increased yield, and greater size.  Hybrids cannot usually 
      be reproduced by seed and must be clonally reproduced (i.e cuttings, grafting, 
      or tissue culture). 
    </p>

    <h3>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h3>
    <p class="w3-margin-left">
      IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or 
      their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat 
      manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties. 
      Pesticides are used only after monitoring indicates they are needed according to 
      established guidelines, and treatments are made with the goal of removing only the 
      target organism. Pest control materials are selected and applied in a manner that 
      minimizes risks to human health, beneficial and nontarget organisms, and the environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Species</h3>
    <p class="w3-margin-left">
      A natural grouping of similar plants (or organisms) that can interbreed. 
      Usually, a species develops over time when the plant group is isolated 
      and through inbreeding becomes a unique species.
      <br><br>
      Naming: Lower case and italize.

    <h3>Sun Exposure</h3>
    <div h4 class="w3-margin-left">
      <h4>What is Full Sun?</h4>
      <p>
        Full sun is defined as more than six hours of direct sun per day. If you live 
        in a newly constructed development or out in the country where there are few 
        trees, your garden may not see any shade at all during the day. Maybe your 
        front porch faces South and has nothing obstructing the sun from mid-morning 
        until early evening. Any amount of sun greater than six hours is considered 
        full sun.
      </p>
      <h4>What is Part Sun?</h4>
      <p>
        Part sun is defined as four to six hours of direct sun per day. Not all those 
        hours need to be accrued consecutively—it could mean a few hours of morning sun 
        plus a few more in the afternoon. When a plant prefers part sun, although it does 
        not need to be in direct sun all day, it will grow and bloom best with at least 
        some of those hours being in the afternoon. These plants need some heat and 
        intense sun exposure in order to produce flowers and new growth.
      </p>
      <h4>What is Part Shade?</h4>
      <p>
        Part shade is also defined as four to six hours of direct sun per day, but most 
        of that should come in the morning hours when the sun’s rays are less intense. 
        We say that plants which prefer part shade enjoy “cool sun”, meaning direct sun 
        in the morning or evening and protection from the hot midday sun.
      </p>
      <h4>What is Full Shade?</h4>
      <p>
        Full shade is defined as less than four hours of direct sun per day. Notice we 
        didn’t say zero hours of direct sun—that would be dense shade which is the darkest 
        of all light levels where few plants can survive. Full shade loving plants enjoy a 
        few hours of sun each day, preferably in the morning. 
      </p>

    <h3>Sunset Zones</h3>
    <p class="w3-margin-left">
      Sunset climate zones consider the total climate.  Including the following factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Winter minimum temperature</li>
      <li>Summer maximum temperature</li>
      <li>Length of growing season</li>
      <li>Humidity</li>
      <li>Rainfall patterns (timing and amount)</li>
      <li>Wind</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Variety</h3>
    <p class="w3-margin-left">
      In plant taxonomy, a variety is a plant within a species group in nature that 
      forms a trait. The trait is stable and can be reproduced either by seed or by 
      cuttings or grafting.  A naturally occurring variation within a plant species, 
      often arising from genetic mutations or environmental factors.
